## Project details: 
This project contains a dummy UI for running SQL queries. This is built using Next.js framework and hosted on Vercel.
The hosted app can be found at : https://sql-playground-ui.vercel.app/

Here's a brief walkthrough video of the project: https://www.loom.com/share/f3838549cce14aa3bbeb895a7264a6a2?sid=e9ea389a-7c12-48d4-918c-cbea358fc76f

Some of the major plugins used are:
1. `nanostores` : a tiny state management library for managing UI state on the frontend.
2. `react-resizable-panels` : for resizing various sections of the UI.
3. `csv-parse` : for mocking table data from query API calls using a csv file.
